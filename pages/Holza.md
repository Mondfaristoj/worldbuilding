- As a child from a poor peasant family, he has had to help out with the chores from an early age. One of his job is to go out and fetch water for his family, for this, he heads a village well, one of the two servicing his village. He attaches the bucket to the hook, and lowering it is the easy part, but water, despite its looks, is surprisingly heavy, and he can't really pull it up on his own, so he mumbles some little spell, it's a bit unwieldy and time consuming to say but he's gotten used to it at this point. Then he tugs on the rope, and like clockwork the bucket climbs up, slowly, bit by bit, then he tries to push the bucket to another raised platform, it spills around as water does 
  Eventually he does get it to the platform, and cranks a hand to lower it down where his little trolley is waiting he does the same thing for the 2nd bucket, but this time there's an adult helping him out. Kap knows a bit more than the average peasant when it comes to magic, he was lucky to get his hands on a notepad that a apprentice mage left behind .
  So when the boy pulls, this time the bucket feels lighter, and Kap helped the lad get the 2nd bucket onto the trolley, Holza said bye, and carefully pushed the cart back to his home
