- ### Magic / hog talking
	- It's hereditary.
	- You have to **learn** it.
	- Mind over matter, magic works because of a supernatural connection between the user and the object affected. Kind of meditating, but weirder because I don't know how to make it make sense anyways, it's magic!
	- Anything is possible.
	- Easy things are really easy, and it gets very hard very fast after that.
