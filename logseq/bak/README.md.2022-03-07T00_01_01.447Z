# Worldbuilding Project

A Cacollaborative, inside-out worldbuilding project.

## How to use/read/participate

The wiki is managed using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), just download this repository, and add it like any other graph.

We also communicate using [Discord](https://discord.com/), in a [custom server](https://discord.gg/4UKUF78REF), so join in if you have any ideas, problems using Logseq or just want to know more about the project!
